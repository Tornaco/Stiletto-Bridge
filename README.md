# Stiletto-Bridge
Placing our lib in frameworks/ as an executable command that can be launched in shell by
```
# stiletto [PARAMS]
```
That can reach the goal that our 3-rd app can call system api easyily through this bridge.
But, most of SystemApi need a root permission. I pasued this project for this.

See impl on N. https://github.com/Tornaco/Stiletto-Bridge/tree/N
